# Minirogue-Clone
Repository contains code for the game development project of COM SCI 32: Data Structures and Algorithms (taken Spring 2020 with Prof. Smallberg). The project creates a text visual console-based version of the Minirogue game. The game consists of five dungeon levels as well as interaction with a variety of elements, such as monsters, items, the inventory, etc.

To run the game, ensure that all files are located in the same directory. Build and run the main.cpp file (e.g. can be done on Visual Studio XXXX). If you encounter runtime performance issues, run in release mode as opposed to debug mode (Visual Studio users).
